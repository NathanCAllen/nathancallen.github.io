      I grew up in the suburbs of Boston. I started my studies at Tufts in the
      fall of 2015, and have been pursuing majors in computer science and
      physics. In my free time, I like to make simple web apps and video games.
      You can find links to, and descriptions of, the projects I'm most proud
      of in the 'Projects' tab (coming soon!).

      When I'm not chasing bugs, I can be found reading a sci-fi or fantasy
      novel, particularly one by R.A. Salvatore, Timothy Zahn, or Brandon
      Sanderson, or designing the next dungeon in my D&amp;D campaign. I'm always on
      the hunt for a well-designed D&amp;D module or a realized fantasy setting, so
      don't be afraid to reach out!
