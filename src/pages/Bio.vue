      I grew up in the suburbs of Boston. I started my studies at Tufts in the
      fall of 2015, and have been pursuing majors in computer science and
      physics. I love designing and implementing web apps. I also love fantasy
      and sci-fi, especially the works of R.A. Salvatore, Timothy Zahn, and
      George R.R. Martin. I also love sprawling open-world RPGs and weird indie
      games with cute graphics. I intend to graduate in the spring of 2019, with
      fanfare and a job.
